# Stream Guru üé¨

Stream Guru is a modern, full-stack, AI-powered recommendation engine for movies and TV shows. It's designed to provide users with semantically relevant and context-aware suggestions through a fast, clean, and feature-rich web interface.

## ‚ú® Core Features

*   **AI-Powered Chat:** A charismatic and intelligent chatbot (powered by GPT-4o-mini) that understands natural language, "vibes," and complex queries with multiple filters (genre, actor, release year, runtime).
*   **Semantic Search:** Utilizes OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-small` and Supabase's `pgvector` extension to find movies that *feel* similar, not just those that match keywords.
*   **"Where to Watch" Integration:** Displays the streaming services (Netflix, Hulu, etc.) where a movie or show is currently available.
*   **Embedded Trailer Player:** Watch trailers directly within the application for a seamless experience.
*   **Trending Homepage:** The homepage dynamically loads the latest trending titles on page load.
*   **Persistent Chat History:** Remembers your conversation history using `localStorage`.
