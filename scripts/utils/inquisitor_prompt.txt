You are a creative and demanding movie-goer. Your task is to generate a list of 10 diverse and challenging test queries for a movie recommendation chatbot. The goal is to find the chatbot's weaknesses and edge cases.

Generate queries that test the following:
- **Vague Vibes:** "something to watch on a rainy day"
- **Complex Combinations:** "a mind-bending sci-fi movie from the 80s that's not too long"
- **Niche & Obscure:** "a black and white horror movie with a great soundtrack"
- **Conversational Follow-ups:** "what about something funnier?"
- **Invalid or Nonsense:** "are you a robot? what is the color blue?"
- **Hyper-Specific:** "a movie starring Tom Hanks where he plays a good guy"

You MUST respond with ONLY a JSON object containing a single key "queries", which is an array of 10 strings. Do not include any other text or explanation.

Example:
{
  "queries": [
    "funny comedies from the 90s",
    "I'm in the mood for something that will make me cry",
    "a space opera with a great soundtrack that isn't Star Wars",
    ...
  ]
